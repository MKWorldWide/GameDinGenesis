# Migration Notes

This document outlines the changes made during the repository rehabilitation and any actions that might be required.

## Changes Made

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflows
- Added `ci.yml` for continuous integration:
  - Runs on push to `main` and pull requests
  - Includes linting, type checking, and testing
  - Builds the application
  - Deploys to Vercel on push to `main`
- Added `pages.yml` for GitHub Pages deployment:
  - Sets up a basic documentation site
  - Can be extended with VitePress or similar later

### 2. Documentation
- Created `DIAGNOSIS.md` with repository analysis
- Updated `README.md` with current project information
- Added this `MIGRATION_NOTES.md` file

### 3. Developer Experience
- Added `.editorconfig` for consistent code style
- Enhanced `.gitignore` for better coverage
- Added GitHub issue and pull request templates

## Required Actions

### For Repository Owners
1. **Vercel Deployment**
   - Add `VERCEL_TOKEN` to GitHub repository secrets
   - Configure the Vercel project if not already done

2. **GitHub Pages**
   - Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
   - Select `gh-pages` branch as the source

3. **Branch Protection**
   - Enable branch protection for `main`
   - Require status checks to pass before merging
   - Require pull request reviews
   - Require linear history

### For Developers
1. **Node.js Version**
   - Ensure you're using Node.js 18.18.0 or higher
   - Consider using a version manager like `nvm` or `fnm`

2. **Development Environment**
   - Install dependencies with `npm ci` for clean installs
   - Run `npm run dev` to start the development server

## Known Issues

1. **Test Coverage**
   - Current test coverage is not being measured
   - Consider adding test coverage reporting with `c8` or `v8`

2. **End-to-End Testing**
   - No end-to-end testing is currently configured
   - Consider adding Playwright or Cypress for E2E tests

## Future Improvements

1. **Documentation**
   - Add more detailed API documentation
   - Create a proper documentation site with VitePress

2. **CI/CD**
   - Add automated dependency updates with Dependabot
   - Add automated release management

3. **Performance**
   - Add bundle size monitoring
   - Implement code splitting and lazy loading

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to rollback these changes:

1. Delete the `.github/workflows` directory to remove CI/CD pipelines
2. Remove the newly added documentation files
3. Revert any changes to existing files
